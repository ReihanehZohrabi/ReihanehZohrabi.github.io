											<dt>Your Out-of-Distribution Detection Method is Not Robust!</dt>

												<p>M. Azizmalayeri, A. Soltani Moakhar, A. Zarei, <b>R. Zohrabi</b>, M.T. Manzuri, M.H. Rohban, “Your Out-of-Distribution Detection Method is Not Robust!”, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2022. Available:<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/1f6591cc41be737e9ba4cc487ac8082d-Abstract-Conference.html">https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/1f6591cc41be737e9ba4cc487ac8082d-Abstract-Conference.html</a><br>
													<blockquote>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has recently gained substantial attention due to the importance of identifying out-of-domain samples in reliability and safety. Although OOD detection methods have advanced by a great deal, they are still susceptible to adversarial examples, which is a violation of their purpose. To mitigate this issue, several defenses have recently been proposed. Nevertheless, these efforts remained ineffective, as their evaluations are based on either small perturbation sizes, or weak attacks. In this work, we re-examine these defenses against an end-to-end PGD attack on in/out data with larger perturbation sizes, e.g. up to commonly used 
														ϵ = 8/255
														 for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Surprisingly, almost all of these defenses perform worse than a random detection under the adversarial setting. Next, we aim to provide a robust OOD detection method. In an ideal defense, the training should expose the model to almost all possible adversarial perturbations, which can be achieved through adversarial training. That is, such training perturbations should based on both in- and out-of-distribution samples. Therefore, unlike OOD detection in the standard setting, access to OOD, as well as in-distribution, samples sounds necessary in the adversarial training setup. These tips lead us to adopt generative OOD detection methods, such as OpenGAN, as a baseline. We subsequently propose the Adversarially Trained Discriminator (ATD), which utilizes a pre-trained robust model to extract robust features, and a generator model to create OOD samples. We noted that, for the sake of training stability, in the adversarial training of the discriminator, one should attack real in-distribution as well as real outliers, but not generated outliers. Using ATD with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as the in-distribution data, we could significantly outperform all previous methods in the robust AUROC while maintaining high standard AUROC and classification accuracy.

													Workshop on Spurious Correlations, Invariance, and Stability, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2023, Accepted for Publication, * equal contribution.
													<blockquote>Deep neural networks have exhibited remarkable performance in various domains. However, the reliance of these models on spurious features has raised concerns about their reliability. A promising solution to this problem is last-layer retraining, which involves retraining the linear classifier head on a small subset of data without spurious cues. Nevertheless, selecting this subset requires human supervision, which reduces its scalability. Moreover, spurious cues may still exist in the selected subset. As a solution to this problem, we propose a novel ranking framework that leverages an open vocabulary object detection technique to identify images without spurious cues. More specifically, we use the object detector as a measure to score the presence of the target object in the images. Next, the images are sorted based on this score, and the last-layer of the model is retrained on a subset of the data with the highest scores. Our experiments on the ImageNet-1k dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of this ranking framework in sorting images based on spuriousness and using them for last-layer retraining.

											<dt>The Language Model, Resources, and Computational Pipelines for the Under-Resourced Iranian Azerbaijani</dt>

													The 13th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing and the 3rd Conference of the Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (IJCNLP-AACL), 2023, Accepted for Publication, * equal contribution.
													<blockquote>Iranian Azerbaijani is a dialect of the Azerbaijani language spoken by more than 16% of the population in Iran (>14 million). Unfortunately, a lack of computational resources is one of the factors that puts this language and its rich culture at risk of extinction. This work aims to create fundamental natural language processing (NLP) resources and pipelines for the processing and analysis of Iranian Azerbaijani introducing standard datasets and starter models for various NLP tasks such as language modeling, text classification, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and machine translation. The proposed resources have been curated and pre-processed to facilitate the development of NLP models for Iranian Azerbaijani and provide a strong baseline for further research and development. This study is an example of bridging the gap in NLP for low-resource languages and promoting the advancement of language technologies in underrepresented languages. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, this paper presents major infrastructures for the processing and analysis of Iranian Azerbaijani, with the ultimate goal of improving communication and information access for millions of individuals.

													The 13th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing and the 3rd Conference of the Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (IJCNLP-AACL), 2023, Accepted for Publication.
													<blockquote>Recent advancements in neural language models have revolutionized natural language understanding. However, many languages still face the risk of being left behind without the benefits of such advancements, potentially leading to their extinction. One such language is Azerbaijani in Iran, which suffers from limited digital resources and a lack of alignment between spoken and written forms. In contrast, Azerbaijani in the Republic of Azerbaijan has seen more resources and is not considered as low-resource as its Iranian counterpart. In this context, our research focuses on the computational progress made in Iranian Azerbaijani language. We propose a transliteration model that leverages an Azerbaijani parallel dataset, effectively bridging the gap between the Latin and Persian scripts. By enabling seamless communication between these two scripts, our model facilitates cultural exchange and serves as a valuable tool for transfer learning.
														The effectiveness of our approach surpasses traditional rule-based methods, as evidenced by the significant improvements in performance metrics. We observe a minimum 15% increase in BLEU scores and a reduction of at least 1/3 in edit distance. Furthermore, our model's online demo is accessible at <a href="//azeri.parsi.ai/">this link</a>".

											<dt>Comparison of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks in hyperspectral image analysis of fruits applied to orange bruise detection</dt>
											<dd>
												<p>R. Pourdarbani, S. Sabzi, <b>R. Zohrabi</b>, G. Garcia-Mateos, R. Fernandez-Beltran, J. Miguel Molina-Martinez, M.H. Rohban,, "Comparison of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks in hyperspectral image analysis of fruits applied to orange bruise detection",<br>
													Journal of Food Science, 2023, (Under Review).
													<blockquote>Recent advances in hyperspectral imaging have demonstrated its ability to detect defects in fruit that may not be visible in RGB images. Hyperspectral images can be considered as 3D images containing two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension. Therefore, the first question that arises is how to process this type of information, either using 2D or 3D models.

														In this study, hyperspectral imaging in the 550-900 nm spectral range was used to detect bruising in oranges. Sixty samples of Thompson oranges were subjected to a mechanical bruising process, and hyperspectral images were taken at different time intervals: before bruising, and 8 and 16 hours after bruising.
														
														The samples were then classified using two convolutional neural network (CNN) models, a shallow 7-layer network (CNN-7) and a deep 18-layer network (CNN-18). In addition, two different input processing approaches are used: using 2D information from each band, and using the full 3D data from each hyperspectral image. The 3D models were the most accurate, with 94% correct classification for 3D-CNN-18, compared to 90% for 3D-CNN-7, and less than 83% for the 2D models.
														
														Our study suggests that 3D hyperspectral imaging may be a more effective technique for detecting fruit bruising, allowing the development of a fast, accurate, and non-destructive method for fruit sorting.
