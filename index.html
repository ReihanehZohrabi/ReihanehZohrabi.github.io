											<h3>Advanced Machine Learning</h3>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">In my projects on Advanced Machine Learning, I have delved into a rich array of techniques and methodologies, implementing multi-task learning algorithms with multi-head architecture using the Omniglot dataset as a foundation. Additionally, I've explored the world of meta-learning through the utilization of algorithms like SNAIL and MAML. In the realm of reinforcement learning, I've ventured into skill discovery with methods such as DADS and DIAYN. My research has also extended to the development of multi-task and meta reinforcement learning algorithms, as well as the exploration of continual learning techniques like GEM. These endeavors collectively contribute to a deeper understanding and proficiency in the ever-evolving field of Machine Learning.</p>

											<h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">In my journey through Natural Language Processing (NLP), I've engaged in diverse projects covering a range of NLP challenges and applications. One noteworthy project is the ongoing development of a Persian Language Model (LLM), a collaboration with the Machine Learning Lab and Natural Language Processing and Digital Humanities Lab. In this role, I handle data preparation in Persian for LLM training as a member of the Data Preparation Team, and lead the Training Team in overseeing the model training process. These experiences have deepened my NLP expertise and enriched my skills in language modeling and multilingual NLP. You can find some of these NLP projects on my GitHub.</p>

											<h3>Adversarially Trained Discriminator</h3>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has recently gained substantial attention due to the importance of identifying out-of-domain samples in reliability and safety. Although OOD detection methods have advanced by a great deal, they are still susceptible to adversarial examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose the Adversarially Trained Discriminator (ATD), which utilizes a pre-trained robust model to extract robust features, and a generator model to create OOD samples. This method could significantly outperform previous methods.</p>

											<h3>Borderless Azerbaijani Processing</h3>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite recent advancements in neural language models, low-resource languages like Azerbaijani in Iran often lag behind in benefiting from these breakthroughs. Our research addresses this gap by proposing a transliteration model that utilizes an Azerbaijani parallel dataset to bridge the gap between the Latin and Persian scripts. This facilitates cultural exchange and enhances transfer learning, surpassing traditional methods with a minimum 15% increase in BLEU scores and a 1/3 reduction in edit distance.
